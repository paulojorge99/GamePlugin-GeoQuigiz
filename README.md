## GeoQuigiz 
### A QGIS plugin

###### With this plugin, it is intended that, through a button in QGIS, the user can play 2 games, related to the countries/capitals of the world, and their flags.

###### In the option "Explore", the user can click on a point of the world map, getting to know the country, its capital and the flag of that country appears.

###### In a first game "Capitals' Game", where the world map appears and a window appears with a random capital, the player will have to click on the point of the map where he thinks it is the respective capital.

###### In the second game "Flags' Game", a window appears with a random flag, and the player will have to click on the point of the map where they think it is the country with their flag. 

###### In both games, the player has 3 tries and the last, if he misses, the correct location appears, moving on to the next question. A total of five questions are asked per game. As you hit, the locations are recorded on the map.

###### In this game, there is also the "Exit" option, if the user wants to leave the game.
